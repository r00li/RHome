RHome Serial protocol!

----------------------------------------------------

Simple character based commands are sent between
arduino and the host. Each message consists of 
two character op code, equal sign, message body
and a null terminating character:

	OP=xxxxx\0

Below is a list of currently implemented op codes:
(op codes in the examples do not show the null
terminator!)

----------------------------------------------------

LU=[light number: 1,2,É][status: 1(ON), 0(OFF)]

example:
	LU=21
	-> Turns the number 2 light ON

notes:
	status code 3 can be used to dim the
	lights if diming is supported.

	controller (arduino) responds by 
	resending the message to confirm that
	the message has been received
